# spacecraft_analysis
Analysing data on currently operating spacecraft from ucsusa.org.
Using excel table from https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database with some changes 
(commentary columns, sparse columns and not very useful for current case data have been removed)
several interesting (well, at least interesting for me) aspects of modern spacecraft utilizing have been visualized.
Also, I tried to implement (somewhat successfully) K-means clustering to separate 4 orbit classes by two orbital parameters: perigee and eccentricity.
